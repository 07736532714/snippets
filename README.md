# Android Snippets
This repository holds code snippets used in Android documentation on [developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com/guide).
It is a work in progress, as many snippets are still embedded as static HTML.

# Quality Assurance
The code snippets compile and show best practices. Runtime verification is not needed;
code irrelevant to the doc is usually stubbed out.

# Contributing
We love contributions! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.
