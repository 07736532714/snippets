# Background
New snippets on developer.android.com/guides will be dynamically linked to this repo instead of 
written as embedded HTML on the page.

# Contributing
We accept your pull requests! The code must compile and show best practices. Runtime verification 
is not needed; code irrelevant to the doc can be stubbed out.
