# Android Snippets
This repository holds code snippets used in Android documentation on [developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com/guide).
The idea is that by having a small sample project show the code snippets will give developers more context to the overall code needed to
implement an API.

It is a work in progress, as many snippets are still embedded as static HTML.
